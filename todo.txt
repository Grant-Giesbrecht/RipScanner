Aight my dude, here's the play. Rather than some iterative, guess and check slow method,
you get the auto-vertical-scale by doing two complete runs through the TF. The first run
sets the ampl. by a very crude (high value) constant (ie. give 2V/div w/ 1Vpp in). The data are used to get an estimate for the TF which is used to calculate close vertical-
scales for the second TF. You'll need a setting, enable dual-auto or one-pass-auto?

* Add an "Aquisition" panel which lets you select how the program determines
scope settings. The two options would be "Automatic" and "From File". You
could then feed it a file with V/div & t/div, trigger level, single vs normal
trigger. It will also let you select between Vrms, Vpp, and both.

* Add a progress bar which shows how far along the scan is. If you do a very
high res scan (maybe 100 sample points) it might take upwards of a minute or
so. (it's actually slower than that by a lot). 

*Add a feature to automatically shift to the next freq band/gain and give the
user just a "fire" button to move onto the next stage after the circuit
has been adjusted.

*Add a "Repeat scan?" confirmation message box if a scan is repeated

* Add a panel ("Generator:") which lets the user control some AWG settings
Freq mode: auto (min, default, max ?) from file (input amplitudes)
Ampl mode: Freq

amplitude: Sel. frquency
frequency: sel. amplitude (fix, variable (min, max)), file
