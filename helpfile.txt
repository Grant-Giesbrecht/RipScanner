============== RIP SCANNER HELP ===============

This program is designed to scan the transfer functions
of the GEQ line of equalizers produced by Giesbrecht
Electronics. Each band is measured, saved, displayed,
and can be saved to a KV1 file for additional analysis.

Scanned param:
Determines if the program will scan output amplitude vs
frequency or input amplitude. 

Aux. Channels: Determine if channels 3 and/or 4 should
also have their voltages recorded vs. the scanned param.

Frequency Entry:
The frequency entry box accepts frequencies separated by
commas. Don't write units, Hertz is expected. This value
is only used if 'linear' or 'log' is selected from the
radiobuttons.

Frequency Band:
These controls are only enabled when the scanned param is
set to 'Freq. (multi-band)'. It is designed to simplify
the GEQ1/2 QA process. It allows the user to save the
TF to a specific band/gain pair and save a set of 7 pairs
to one characterizing KV1 file.

Scan Status:
This indicator only present valid data when the scanned 
param is set to 'Freq. (multi-band)'. It designates which
band/gain pairs have had their TF collected.

Control Mode:
Specifies how the oscilloscope's settings are determined
during a scan. 'Auto' lets the program determine the
settings, whereas 'From File' lets you specify a file
containing the specific settings you'd like to use.
